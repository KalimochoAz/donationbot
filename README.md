# Donation Tracker

The ultimate discord bot to track donations of clans, families and individuals.

It has 4 main features:

    1. DonationBoard:
        Create a live-updating table of all donations 
        for all members in any claimed clan. 
        This will update within 60 seconds of 
        someone donating/receiving donations, 
        and will persist across people leaving and rejoining.    
       
    2. Events Logging
        Find out who donated to you when with an events log.
        If enabled, it will send a message to the channel 
        with the people who donated and received troops in a 60sec interval. 
        Handy for tracking and isolating people who keep 
        on giving wrong troops.
        
       
    3. `+don`
         Find the donations of a clan, clash player, 
         discord user or all members claimed in a server.
         This will persist across people leaving/joining 
         and will be paginated where applicable.
        
    4. `+events`
        Find the last time a player, discord user, 
        clan or server last donated, or find historical info 
        about who donated what eg. 2 days, or 10 hours ago.
     
     
I would prefer if you didn't run an instance of the bot, just invite the bot to your server.
